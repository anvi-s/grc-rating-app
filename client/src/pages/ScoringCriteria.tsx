              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
                Each platform is scored across 10 key criteria, with weighted scores contributing to an overall rating out of 5 points. Each catgeory can be loosely classified as high priority (â‰¥ 12%), medium priority (8-10%), and low priority (&lt;7%). Categories were compared to decide how critical each factor is to the core function of GRC tools, as well as how commonly they are cited as priorities by real-world users (compliance officers, risk managers, IT security leads, etc.).
